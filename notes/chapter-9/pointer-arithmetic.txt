Some math operations can be performed on pointers.

The contents of a pointer variable may be changed with mathematical statements that
perform addition or subtraction.

This is demonstrated in program 9-9. The first loop increments the pointer variable, 
stepping through each element of the array. The second loop decrements the pointer, 
stepping it through the array backward.
