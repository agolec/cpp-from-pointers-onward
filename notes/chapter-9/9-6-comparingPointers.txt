If one memory address comes before another address in memory, the first address is
considered "less than" the second. C++'s relational operators may be used
to compare pointer values.

pointers may be compared with any of C++'s relational operators.

>, <, ==, !=, >=, <=

Inside an array, memory addresses are stored in consecutive memory addresses.
So the address 0 comes before the address 1. 1 is > than 0.

To perform this kind of comparison, the code would look like this:

int* pointerToSet = nullPtr;
const int SIZE = 5;
int set[SIZE] = { 0,5,10,3,49};
pointerToSet = &set;

if(&set[1] > &set[0])

if(set < &set[4])

if(set == &set[0])

if(&set[2] != &arr[3])


USES:

Comparing addresses allows us to make sure we do not go beyond the boundaries of an array.

Program 9-10 shows us this.
