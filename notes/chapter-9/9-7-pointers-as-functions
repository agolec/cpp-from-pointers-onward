pointers can be used as function parameters. This gives us access to the original variable
being passed in as an argument. The argument is said to be passed by reference in this
case.

void doubleValue(int *val){
    *val += 2;
}

although this method is a void return type, whatever int argument that is being passed in
will have a value twice it's original size once this method finishes execution and 
returns from the call to doubleValue.
